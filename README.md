## How It Works

1. **Initialization:**  
   The `DigitalClock` class sets up the main window, configures its appearance, and initializes the clock and header.

2. **Real-Time Updates:**  
   The `update_time_on_clock` method retrieves the current system time and updates the clock display every second using `Tkinter`'s `after()` method.

3. **Execution:**  
   The application runs continuously, keeping the time accurate until the user closes the window.
